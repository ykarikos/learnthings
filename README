Learnthings shows images and plays sounds of things. It is meant for
small kids to learn to recognize e.g. animals.

The media subdirectory contains photos and sounds of different kind of
things. I've collected some public domain or free photos and sounds of
animals and birds there.

Usage: ./learnthings.py category
Category must be found as a subdirectory under media. Try
./learnthings animals

The program quits with the keyboard sequence "quit".
New things are displayed after any eight keys are pressed.

Requirements: Python and Pygame
