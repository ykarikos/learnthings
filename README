Learnthings shows images and plays sounds of things. It is meant for
small kids to learn to recognize e.g. animals.

The media subdirectory contains photos and sounds of different kind of
animals and birds. There's also audio files containing the names of
the things as synthesized speech in English and Finnish. Give the
optinal language parameter to play also the names.

Usage: ./learnthings.py category [language]

Category must be found as a subdirectory under media. Try
./learnthings animals en
./learnthings birds en

The program quits with the keyboard sequence "quit". New things are displayed
after two seconds have elapsed and any three keys are pressed. Change
timeTreshold and keypressTreshold to adjust when new things are displayed.

Requirements: Python and Pygame
